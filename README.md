# BC2410 Project
In this project, we analysed the application of linear optimisation model on the Fantasy Premier League. We aim to help new managers with choosing the optimal fantasy premier league squad.

We created 2 user personas, one passive manager, who does not make any transfers and one active manager, who makes transfers every week.

We also conducted sensitivity analysis and presented our findings. The data can be found in the `clean_data` and `raw_data` folders.
